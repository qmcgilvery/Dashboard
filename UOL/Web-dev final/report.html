    <p> My site is about a fitness group that trains members to improve their physical capacity to perform work (exercise). The group also holds fitness competitions to evaluate a persons work capacity.
    The structure I chose to implement was a minimal, responsive, uncluttered approach that made useful information easy to find.
    </p>
<h3>2</h3>
    <p>I started by looking at how current fitness clubs layout their sites, in particular <a href="https://www.westlaathletics.com/">westlaathletics.com/</a>,
    which I then modified to suit my needs and taste.  I also drew from my previous experience in designing websites, in particular <a href="https://accidentalimpacts.org/">accidentalimpacts.org</a> and
        <a href="https://moworkouts.com/">moworkouts.com</a> (which is also a web-app). Lastly and probably most important I chose this due to my background and interest in fitness. I have worked as a fitness instructor for many years and would potentially
        like to create a gym like this.

    <p>The image tags have relevant descriptions. The contrast is high, font size is large and it is responsive. I did not use color as a way to navigate through the site</p>
<h3>4</h3>
    <p>I tried to make it as intuitive as possible. I tried to convey useful and relevant information. I took responsiveness into consideration</p>
<h3>5</h3>
    <p>I had to learn how to implement a table that could be ordered by column. For that I used a library called datatables. I had to re-learn how to implement a bootstrap modal popup window. For that I looked at some old code I had written but mostly ended up discarding for bootstrap documentation. I had to re-learn how to set a cookie using javascript. For that I used W3C</p>
<h3>6</h3>
    <p>I think my code and commenting came out a lot cleaner than on projects I have worked on in the past. I've mostly worked on projects by myself and when I go back to look at my code it's not always easy to understand.
        At least not as easy as it should be considering I wrote it.</p>
<h3>7</h3>
    <p>For this project I think using my own images and videos would have made the site look more tailored to what I had in mind and not so generic.</p>
